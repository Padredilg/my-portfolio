						<span className="indentation">-----</span>I am a Full-Stack Web Developer currently looking for a full-time position. I also happen to be midway-through my path to obtain an Aerospace Engineering Bachelor's Degree from University of Central Florida <span className="obs-text">(Hence the overall theme <span className="obs-smiley">:)</span> )</span>.

						<span className="indentation">-----</span>I grew up in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and moved to the US back in 2016. I graduated from Monarch High School 2 years later, but, due to financial hardship and other obstacles that I faced as an immigrant, I was unable to start college right after. So, I joined the work-force and took whatever jobs were available for me. That included: waiter, car-wash attendant, construction employee, night-shift restaurant cleaner, and whatever else was available.

						<span className="indentation">-----</span>I finally joined Eco Printing when it was founded in November of 2017 as its production specialist, and later became their production manager. <span className="obs-text">(OBS.: I took the challenge to learn everything through trial and error, and I succeeded)</span>. This job gave me the opportunity to start my college career in January of 2019!

						<span className="indentation">-----</span>When I started studying at Palm Beach State College I already knew that I would enjoy my STEM classes. However, I fell madly in love with Math when I took the first course of the Calculus trilogy, and at that moment I knew I had to become an Engineer! My efforts at keeping a 4.0 GPA as a <span className="full-word">full</span>-time engineering student and <span className="full-word">full</span>-time worker helped me obtain a <span className="full-word-success">full</span>-scholarship through the PBSC Foundation, and I will be forever grateful for their help.

						<span className="indentation">-----</span>After obtaining my AA at PBSC, I became a <span className="ucf-knight">UCF Knight</span> to further pursue my education as an Aerospace Engineer. One of the required courses towards my major was Intro to C, and it was then that I met coding, the second passion of my life. While I am still an Aerospace Engineering student, I decided to expand my coding experience by enrolling in the UCF Web Development Bootcamp, and that is how I became a Full-Stack Web Developer while still pursuing an Aerospace Engineering Degree.
