                                    <h4>How did I end up here?</h4>
                                    <p>I grew up in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and moved to the US back in 2014. I graduated from Monarch High School 2 years later, but, due to financial hardship and other obstacles that I faced as an immigrant, I was unable to start college at the time. Therefore, I joined the work-force and took whatever jobs were available for me. That included: waiter/server, car-wash attendant, construction employee, and night-shift restaurant-cleaner. By November of 2017 I joined Eco Printing Corp, and after saving for a little more than a year, I was able to start my college career in January of 2019!</p>

                                    <h4>Why Engineering?</h4>
                                    <p>When I started studying at Palm Beach State College I already knew that I would enjoy my STEM classNamees. However, I fell madly in love with Math when I took the first course of the Calculus trilogy, and at that moment I knew I had to become an Engineer! My efforts at keeping a 4.0 GPA as a <span classNameName="full-word">full</span>-time engineering student and <span classNameName="full-word">full</span>-time worker helped me obtain a <span classNameName="full-word-success">full</span>-scholarship through the PBSC Foundation, and I will be forever grateful for their help.</p>

                                    <h4>What Now?</h4>
                                    <p>After obtaining my AA at PBSC, I became a <span className="ucf-knight">UCF Knight</span> to further pursue my education as an Aerospace Engineer. One of the required courses towards my major was Intro to C, and it was then that I met coding, the second passion of my life. While still an Aerospace Engineering student, I decided to expand my coding experience by enrolling in the UCF Web Development Bootcamp, and that is how I also became a Full-Stack Web Developer.</p>
